# Sinusbot WelcomeSound player
This is a simple script written because of the new GTA online update to play the "Angel AI" sounds whenever a user joins a channel where a bot is.

## What it can do?
+ Picks a random song/sound from a custom playlist
+ If something is already playing you can choose to override it

## Install
Simply copy this script to the "scripts" folder in your sinusbot install, then restart the bot. After this you will be able to enable the script in your webUI.
