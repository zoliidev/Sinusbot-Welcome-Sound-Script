# Sinusbot WelcomeSound player
This is a simple script written because of the new GTA online update to play the "Angel AI" sounds whenever a user joins a channel where a bot is.

## What it can do?
+ Picks a random song/sound from a custom playlist
+ If something is already playing you can choose to override it

## Install
1. Simply copy this script to the "scripts" folder in your sinusbot install, then restart the bot.
2. After the first step, you will be able to enable the script in your webUI.
3. Create a playlist with your sounds.
4. In the script settings make sure to specify the playlist, and it should just work :)
